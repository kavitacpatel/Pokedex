# Pokedex

This is a fun application of showing list of Pokemon characters.
I have used .csv file with list of characters.
My images are in Assets folder.
Extra feature with music and search function.

Music can be on  thru out application and can be turn off.
I have used text with feature of pokemon.ttf
